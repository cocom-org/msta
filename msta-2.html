<P>MSTA description languages is superset of YACC language.  The major
additional features are Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF) for more
convenient descriptions of languages, additional constructions in
rules for more convenient description of scanners, and named
attributes.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="msta.html#toc2.1">Layout of MSTA description</A>
</H2>

<P>MSTA description structure has the following layout which
is similar to one of YACC file.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     DECLARATIONS
     %%
     RULES
     %%
     ADDITIONAL C/C++ CODE
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The `%%' serves to separate the sections of description.  All sections
are optional.  The first `%%' starts section of keywords and is
obligatory even if the section is empty, the second `%%' may be absent
if section of additional C/C++ code is absent too.</P>
<P>Full YACC syntax of MSTA description file is placed in Appendix 1.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="msta.html#toc2.2">Declarations</A>
</H2>

<P>The section of declarations may contain the following construction:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   %start  identifier
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which determines axiom of the grammar.  If such construction is
absent, the axiom is believed to be nonterminal in the left hand side
of the first rule.  If there are several such construction, all ones
except for the first are ignored.</P>
<P>By default, the values of attributes of the terminals (tokens) and
nonterminals shall be integers.  If you are going to use the values of
different types, you shall use
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   &lt;tag>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in constructs declaring symbols (%token, %type, %left, ...)  and shall
insert corresponding union member names in the following construction:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   %union { body of union in C/C++ }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Alternatively, the union can be declared in interface file, and a
typedef used to define the symbol YYSTYPE (see generated code) to
represent this union.  The effect of %union is to provide the
declaration of YYSTYPE directly from the input.</P>
<P>There is group of the following declarators which take token
(terminal) or nonterminal names as arguments.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   %token [&lt;tag>] name [number] [name [number]]...
   %left [&lt;tag>] name [number] [name [number]]...
   %right [&lt;tag>] name [number] [name [number]]...
   %nonassoc [&lt;tag>] name [number] [name [number]]...
   %type &lt;tag> name...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The names can optionally be preceded by the name of a C/C++ union
member (called a tag see above) appearing within ``&lt;'' and ``>''.  The
use of tag specifies that the tokens or nonterminals named in this
construction are to be of the same C/C++ type as the union member
referenced by the tag.</P>
<P>If symbol used in grammar is undefined by a %token, %left, %right, or
%nonassoc declaration, the symbol will be considered as a nonterminal.</P>
<P>The first occurrence of a given token can be followed by a positive
integer in constructions `%token', `%left', `%right', and `%nonassoc'
defining tokens.  In this case the value assigned to it shall be code
of the corresponding token returned by scanner.</P>
<P>Constructions `%left', `%right', and `%nonassoc' assign precedence and
to the corresponding tokens.  All tokens in the same construction have
the same precedence level and associativity; the constructions is
suggested to be placed in order of increasing precedence.
Construction `%left' denotes that the operators (tokens) in that
construction are left associative, and construction `%right' similarly
denotes right associative operators.</P>
<P>Construction `%nonassoc' means that tokens cannot be used
associatively.  If the parser encounters associative use of this token
it will report an error.</P>
<P>The construction `%type' means that the attributes of the
corresponding nonterminals are of type given in the tag field.</P>
<P>Once the type, precedence, or token number of a symbol is specified,
it shall not be changed.  If the first declaration of a token does not
assign a token number, MSTA will assign a token number.  Once this
assignment is made, the token number shall not be changed by explicit
assignment.</P>
<P>Usually real grammars can not be declared without shift/reduce
conflicts.  To control suggested number of shift/reduce conflicts, the
following construction can be used.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   %expect number
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If such construction is present, MSTA will report error if the number
of shift/reduce conflicts is not the same as one in the construction.
Remember that it is not standard YACC construction.</P>
<P>The following construction in declarations means that the scanner
should be generated.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   %scanner
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

There are the following major differences in parser and scanner
generated by MSTA
<UL>
<LI>In order to use a MSTA generated parser with a MSTA generated
scanner, all objects in a MSTA scanner (variables, types, macro,
and so on) are named by adding letter `s' or `S' after prefixes
`yy' or `YY'.</LI>
<LI>Additional function `yylex_start' is generated.  The function
should be used for initiation of scanner (see Generated code).</LI>
<LI>Function `yylex' is generated instead of function `yyparse'.
This function can be called many times for getting next token.
Code of the next token is suggested to returned by statements
`return' in the actions.  Input stream (look ahead characters)
is saved from a call of `yylex' to the next its call.</LI>
<LI>Instead of function `yylex' a function `yyslex' is
used to read the next character (token in terminology of MSTA
specification file) from the input stream.  -1 is used as the
end of file instead of 0 because scanner must read and process
zero characters.</LI>
<LI>Macro `YYSABORT' is -1 in order to differ token code from
flag of finishing work of the scanner.  Remember that analogous
macro `YYABORT' for MSTA parser is 1.</LI>
<LI>To extract all regular parts in the scanner grammar,
splitting LR-sets is fulfilled (see MSTA implementation).</LI>
</UL>

You can look at a scanner specification in Appendix 2.</P>
<P>There may be also the following constructions in the declaration
section
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     %{
        C/C++ DECLARATIONS
     %}

     %local {
        C/C++ DECLARATIONS
     }

     %import {
        C/C++ DECLARATION
     }

     and

     %export {
        C/C++ DECLARATION
     }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which contain any C/C++ declarations (types, variables, macros, and so
on) used in sections.  Remember the only first construction is
standard POSIX YACC construction.</P>
<P>The local C/C++ declarations are inserted at the begin of generated
implementation file (see section `generated code') but after
include-directive of interface file (if present -- see MSTA Usage).
You also can use more traditional construction of YACC %{ ... %}
instead.</P>
<P>C/C++ declarations which start with `%import' are inserted at the
begin of generated interface file.  If the interface file is not
generated, the code is inserted at the begin of the part of
implementation file which would correspond the interface file.</P>
<P>C/C++ declarations which start with `%export' are inserted at the end
of generated interface file.  For example, such exported C/C++ code
may contain definitions of external variables and functions which
refer to definitions generated by MSTA.  If the interface file is
not generated, the code is inserted at the end of the part of
implementation file which would correspond the interface file.</P>
<P>All C/C++ declarations are placed in the same order as in the section
of declarations.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="msta.html#toc2.3">Rules</A>
</H2>

<P>The section of declarations is followed by section of rules.</P>
<P>The rules section defines the context-free grammar to be accepted by
the function yacc generates, and associates with those rules C
language actions and additional precedence information.  The grammar
is described below, and a formal definition follows.</P>
<P>The rules section contains one or more grammar rules.  A grammar rule
has the following form:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      nonterminal : pattern ;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The nonterminal in the left side hand of the rule describes a language
construction and pattern into which the nonterminal is derivated.  The
semicolon at the end of the rule can be absent.</P>
<P>MSTA can use EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) to describe the
patterns.  Because the pattern can be quite complex, MSTA internally
transforms rules in the description into simple rules and assigns a
unique number to each simple rule.  Simple rule can contains only
sequence of nonterminals and tokens.  Simple rules and the numbers
assigned to the rules appear in the description file (see MSTA usage).
To achieve to the simple rules, MSTA makes the following
transformations (in the same order).

</OL>

After the all possible transformations mentioned above, the rules will
contain sequence of only tokens (literals or token identifiers) and
nonterminals finishing optional %prec or/and %la construction or/and
an action.</P>
<P>The action is an arbitrary C/C++ block, i.e. declarations and
statements enclosed in curly braces { and }.  Certain pseudo-variables
can be used in the action for attribute references.  These are changed
by data structures known internally to MSTA.  The pseudo-variables have
the following forms:
<DL>
<DT><B>$$</B><DD><P>This pseudo-variable denotes the nonterminal in the left
hand side of the simple rule.</P>

<DT><B>$number</B><DD><P>This pseudo-variable refers to the attribute of sequence
element (nonterminal, token, or action) specified by its
number in the right side of the rule before changing actions
inside pattern (see transformation above), reading from left
to right.  The number can be zero or negative.  If it is, it
refers to the attribute of the symbol (token or nonterminal)
on the parser's stack preceding the leftmost symbol of the
rule.  (That is, $0 refers to the attribute of the symbol
immediately preceding the leftmost symbol in the rule, to be
found on the parser's stack, and $-1 refers to the symbol to
its left.)  If number refers to an element past the current
point in the rule (i.e. past the action), or beyond the
bottom of the stack, the result is undefined.</P>

<DT><B>$identifier</B><DD><P>These pseudo-variable is analogous to the previous one but
the attribute name is used instead of its number.  Of course
the attribute naming must exist.</P>

<DT><B>$&lt;...>number</B><DD><P>This pseudo-variable is used when there are attributes of
different types in the grammar and the number corresponds to
the nonterminal whose type is not known because the
nonterminal has been generated during the transformation of
rules into the simple rules.  The type name of the attribute
is placed into angle braces.</P>

<DT><B>$&lt;...>identifier</B><DD><P>These pseudo-variable is analogous to the previous one but
the attribute name is used instead of its number.  Of course
the attribute naming must exist.</P>

<DT><B>$&lt;...>$</B><DD><P>This pseudo-variable is used when there are attributes of
different types in the grammar and the type of nonterminal
is not known because the nonterminal has been generated
during the transformation of rules into the simple rules.</P>
</DL>

Messages about some shift/reduce conflicts are not generated if the
rules in the conflict has priority and associativity.  The priority
and associativity of rule are simply the precedence level and
associativity of the last token in the rule with declared precedence
level and associativity.</P>
<P>The optional construction `%prec ...' can be used to change the
precedence level associated with a particular simple rule.  Examples
of this are in cases where a unary and binary operator have the same
symbolic representation, but need to be given different precedences.
The reserved keyword `%prec' can be followed by a token identifier or
a literal.  It shall cause the precedence of the grammar rule to
become that of the following token identifier or literal.</P>
<P>The optional construction `%la number' can be used to change the
maximal look ahead associated with a particular simple rule.  Example
of this is when there is a classical conflict if-then-else which is to
be resolved correctly with look ahead equal to 1 and there is a rule
with conflict which must be resolved with look ahead equal to 3.  In
this case you can call MSTA with maximal look ahead equal to 1 (this
is default) and place %la 3 in the rule which takes part in the
conflict which must be resolved with look ahead equal to 3.</P>
<P>If a program section follows, the grammar rules shall be terminated by
%%.</P>
