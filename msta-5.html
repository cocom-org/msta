DESCRIPTION
       MSTA reads input grammar which is described in  specifica-
       tion  file  and generates parser for it.  MSTA can process
       any POSIX YACC grammar and generates equivalent parser  in
       the  sence  of POSIX standard.  But MSTA can do many addi-
       tional things: generation of  more  safe  error  recovery,
       better  output of generated parser description, generation
       of fast LALR(k)- and LR(k)-grammar parser with  acceptable
       space  requirements,  generation  of scanners described as
       context-free grammar (CFG), and so on.  The  specification
       file must have suffix `.y'

       The  generated  code  consists  of  optional interface and
       implementation files and optional description file  having
       the  same  names  as  one of specification file and corre-
       spondingly suffixes `.h' (if option -d or -c++  is  given)
       and  `.c'  (C  code)  or  `.cpp'  (C++ code) and `.output'
       (description file).  If MSTA runs in YACC regime, the cor-
       responding  files  will be `y.tab.h' (if option -d or -c++
       is given) and `y.tab.c' (C code) or `y.tab.cpp' (C++ code)
       and `y.output' (description file).

       Full documentation of MSTA is in MSTA User's manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for MSTA and YACC are:

       -d     Create  the  interface file.  By default the inter-
              face file is not generated.

       -l     Insert user's original code into  generated  parser
              without  `#line'  constructs.  By default construc-
              tions `#line' are always generated.

       -t     Permit compilation of debugging code  in  the  code
              file  (tracing of the parser work).  Runtime debug-
              ging statements are always contained in the parser,
              but  by  default conditional compilation directives
              prevent their  compilation.   This  option  defines

MSTA(1)                    User Manuals                   MSTA(1)


              macro  `YYDEBUG'  as  1 (by default its value is 0)
              and as consequence  the  debugging  statements  are
              processed.

       -v     Create a file containing description of the parser.

       -b file_prefix
              Use file_prefix instead of `y' as  the  prefix  for
              all  output filenames when YACC regime of generated
              file names is on.

       -p sym_prefix
              Use sym_prefix instead of yy as the prefix for  all
              external  names  (i.e.  functions yyparse , yylex ,
              and yyerror , and the variables yylval ,  yychar  ,
              and yydebug ) produced by MSTA.

       Additional options which are known only for MSTA are:

       -define
              This is synonym of option `-d'

       -line  This is synonym of option `-l'

       -trace This is synonym of option `-t'

       -verbose
              This is synonym of option `-v'

       -h, -help, --help
              These options result in that only brief description
              of options is output into stderr.  The same  result
              can be achieved by calling MSTA without any options
              and arguments.

       -w     No  any  warning  messages  are   generated,   e.g.
              repeated  description  of type, value, and priority
              of  token  or   terminal,   repeated   construction
              `%start' and many others.

       -c++   Output  of  C++  code  instead  of C code (which is
              default).

       -enum  Generate token constants as enumeration instead  of
              macro.

       -no-enum
              Generate   token   constants   as  macro  (this  is
              default).

       -pattern-equiv
              Equivalent patterns are denoted by the same nonter-
              minal (by default).  Sometimes this results in dra-
              matic reducing conflicts when complex patterns  are

              used.

       -no-pattern-equiv
              Even  equivalent  patterns are denoted by different
              nonterminals and are expanded  into  the  different
              set of rules

       -look-ahead number, -la number
              Determine  maximal  length of look-ahead when LR(k)
              and LALR(k) generated parser.  This does  not  mean
              that MSTA in each situation and for each input will
              look ahead on  given  number  tokens.   MSTA  looks
              ahead only on minimal number of tokens required for
              resolution of a conflict.   The  default  value  of
              maximal look ahead is 1.

       -lr    Input  grammar is considered to be a LR(k)-grammar.

       -no-lr Input grammar is considered to be  a  LALR(k)-gram-
              mar.  This is default.

       -lalr-optimization
              If   the  input  grammar  is  considered  to  be  a
              LR(k)-grammar, MSTA will make  LALR(k)-optimization
              after  building  LR(k)-parser.   It means that MSTA
              will extract  LALR(k)-parts  of  LR(k)-grammar  and
              will represent them by addequate LALR-sets.  If the
              input LR(k)-grammar is "almost" a  LALR(k)-grammar,
              MSTA  can descrease size of the generated parser in
              several  times.   If  the  input   grammar   is   a
              LALR(k)-grammar,  MSTA  will create LALR(k)-parser.
              This option is default when option `-lr' is  given.

       -no-lalr-optimization
              When  option  `-lr'  is  given,  MSTA does not make
              LALR-optimization.

       -regular-optimization
              After building LALR-sets or  LR-sets  and  optional
              LALR-optimization,  MSTA  makes  extracting regular
              parts of input grammar and implement them  by  ade-
              quate  methods  (deterministic  finite  automaton).
              This decreases number of final states in the gener-
              ated  parser,  speeds  up  the  parser, but sigthly
              increases the parser size because some actions will
              be present in several examplars in the parser.  The
              more regular parts in the input grammar, the better
              this method works.  By default this option is on.

       -no-regular-optimization
              Disable the regular optimizations.

       -split-lr-sets
              Splitting  LR-sets  during  regular optimization in

              order to extract the most of  regular  parts  (only
              when  option  `-regular-optimization'  is  on).  By
              default this option is on if `%free_format' is pre-
              sent in the specification file.

       -no-split-lr-sets
              Option is opposite to the previous one.  By default
              this option is on if `%free_format'  is  absent  in
              the specification file.

       -yacc-error-recovery
              The generated parser will use error recover accord-
              ing to Posix YACC standard.

       -no-yacc-error-recovery
              The generated parser  will  use  sligthly  modified
              error  recovery  method.  This method is more safe.
              It is  guaranteed  that  this  method  can  not  be
              cycled.  This error recovery is used by default.

       -yacc-input
              Only Posix YACC input can be used as input grammar.

       -no-yacc-input
              All input grammar features of  MSTA  can  be  used.
              This option is default.

       -yacc-file-names
              MSTA  output  file names are generated according to
              Posix YACC ( y.output , y.tab.c , y.tab.h).

       -strict
              Use only strict POSIX YACC input (this option is in
              action  only   when -yacc-input ) not SYSTEM V one.
              Errors are output when nonstrict features are used.
              These  features  are usage of ';' after definitions
              and C/C++ code insertions and usage of a token  and
              a  literal  in  %type clauses as before and after a
              description of the token  and  the  literal.   This
              option is on by default.

       -no-strict
              This  option  is in action only when -yacc-input is
              on.  Only warnings about non strict POSIX YACC fea-
              tures usage are output.

       -no-yacc-file-names
              Output files will have the same name and suffixes (
              .h , .c , and .output ).   This  option  is  on  by
              default.

       -o     Specify names of output files (header file name.h ,
              code file name.c , description file name.output

       -y, -yacc
              Emulate Posix YACC.   It  means  that  the  options
              `-yacc-input'  , `-lalr' , `-yacc-error-recovery' ,
              and `-yacc-file-names' are on,  and  -c++  is  off.
              This  option  is  useful  with  other options, e.g.
              options `-lr' and `-y' means also  `-yacc-input'  ,
              `-yacc-error-recovery' , and `-yacc-file-names'.

       -full-lr-set
              Write all LR-situations (besides essential ones) of
              LR-sets into a file containing description  of  the
              parser  (the  option  acts only with option `-v' ).
              Sometimes it is  useful  for  better  understanding
              conflicts.   But  in this case the description file
              can be significantly bigger.

       -lr-situation-context
              Write context of LR-situations into description  of
              the  parser  (the option acts only with option `-v'
              ).  Sometimes it is useful for better understanding
              conflicts.   But  in this case the description file
              can be huge espicially for LR(k)- and LALR(k)-gram-
              mar  when  k > 1 or when with option `-full-lr-set'
              parser generation speed because classic  method  of
              LR-,  LALR-sets  is  used  instead  of fast DeRemer
              method.  By default this option is off.

       -removed-lr-sets
              Write LR-sets removed  during  conflict  resolution
              and  regular  optimization  into description of the
              parser (the option acts only with option -v ).   By
              default such unchievable LR-sets are not present in
              the description file.

       -expand
              Attributes and states stacks in the parser will  be
              expandable (this is default).

       -no-expand
              Attributes  and states stacks in the parser will be
              not expandable.

       -time  Output detail time statistics of MSTA work  on  its
              basic passes and optimizations.
