  Better way to install MSTA is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory (in
order to create Makefile for MSTA), to build AMMUNITION and SPRUT
(because MSTA uses them for its building).  After that we can work
with only MSTA (building, installation, and so on).  The MSTA Makefile
has additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM Makefile.  These
are:

test - testing MSTA
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only MSTA

Examples of MSTA specifications file are in `c5.y', `cpp5.y',
`fcalc.y', `fparse.y', `gram.y', `java.y', `m2c.y', `p-yacc.y',
`sql1.y'.  Example of MSTA scanner specification file is in `lex.y'.
